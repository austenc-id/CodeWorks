<summary>Objective</summary>
In this checkpoint students will demonstrate their understanding of working with the DOM and dynamically rendering data to the page. They will be responsible for writing functions to handle input and styling the page utilizing Bootstrap best practices to design the page. In this example setup we will give the example of mining cheese from the moon, however make this your own and add whatever creative flair you choose.

## Requirements
- Users can click on an image to collect a resource
- The current resource total is always displayed
- Users have at least 4 upgrades to purchase
- Users can see the quantity of each upgrade they have purchased
- Users can see the total ammount of modification each upgrade provides
- Users can purchase at least 1 click upgrade
- Users can purchase at least 1 automatic upgrade
- Automatic upgrades are applied at least every 3 seconds
- Users cannot purchase an upgrade if they do not have enough resource
- Purchasing an upgrade decreases the current resource
- Each Upgrade has different modifier values
- When a user purchases an upgrade, the price of the upgrade changes

## Extra Credit
- Users can see the current resource total, and total resource collected
- Instead of a basic count, use images or icons to represent how many of a purchasable the user has
- Prevent the user from writing a loop to click by setting a 'cool-down' between clicks
- Disable the buttons a user cannot purchase and enable them if they have enough money
- Unlock/hide upgrades until the user has enough resources at least once to afford the item
- Consider how you could add bonuses that could increase the multiplier of automaticUpgrades
- Try using localStorage to save your game progress between page reloads
- Create a badge system to mark user milestones ex. award 'The Collector' for mining 1,000,000 total Cheese
- Create a way to decrease the interval of automaticCollection
- Prevent the collectionInterval from being started more than once
